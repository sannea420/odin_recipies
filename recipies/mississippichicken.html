        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is such a fun and simple recipe with only 4 ingredients that can be made in the oven or in the slow cooker. The chicken turns out buttery, spicy, juicy, and herby.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

                <li>1 (16 ounce) jar sliced pepperoncini peppers, drained</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced</li>
